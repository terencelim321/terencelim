Play familiar with that one of the things that we first started talking lot about. Just a product analytics pace and just digital product in general was the power of retention. And so you know even at our user conference i can buy that''s like 2017 is like 4 years ago but we are user conference rather than even just talking just about halfway to reforge workshop and reforges made by brian balfour and uber respectively.

I''m in there''s actually. I''m surprised. That was the obvious which is the money but there''s some surprising things which is also people like to build meaningful products. And you''re actually able to retain employees when you''re building something that works well for your customer. And so i think it''s not something that people jump out and be like oh like what is return the best know what i''m doing it''s like what you''re working on is mabel and you give people on the right tools and can you give them the space to kind of operate and i and i.

You know how do you launch into areas where maybe there''s nobody i can major. Player in those like.
