I think that is akin to the early days of program. I remember when i learned program go to wasn''t acceptable to construct to use and an overtime peoples that wall that leads to a lot of buggy program celeste bill programming languages but we don''t let people use go to statements and then the tools basically made more predictable and less buggy programs so i think we also need we also needs to play also needs we also need.

Another element of biases maybe it''s using some feature. That is some predicting and i''ll come that would appear like it''s racially or gender bias then we may need to reconsider those features by think better tools will go a long way to reducing bias and and the other really important element i think professor benjo mention earlier is to make sure that.

Problems with programming languages because i think people mean well they do once they understand the consequences still focus on it it''s kind of an early problem that emerges and also believe ultimately i should be less biased than people.

Alibaba and so on and that has led to a lot of power and they''re the most powerful companies and some of the issues that professor bengeo has brought up.
